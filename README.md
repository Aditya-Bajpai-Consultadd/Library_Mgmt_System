# Library_Mgmt_System

This flask app contains the complete back-end endpoints that are requested in the Library Management System.  
All the endpoints are tested on postman as well.  
It also have correctly implemented user based role authentication and access of endpoints.  
I have tried to cover most of the edge cases for handling json data, database connections and login session management.  
I have used JSON Object to get request and send response from backend.
Since this is only the backend implementation of the project, it contains a JSON serializer to send the data from backend to frontend  
to enhance readability and manageability of the code.
